    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caracteristics of the model:\n",
    "Accuracy:\n",
    "- if used as a clearing tool removing overburden upfront, and thus only to get rid of obvious cases, the accuracy of such a tool could be its most important caracteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability:\n",
    "- could help families understand the decision (although not as important as in diseases predictions).\n",
    "- can also highlight and thus control biases (racial, sex, age).\n",
    "- since the tool would probably be used in combination with human selection, it could help save time by highlighting the main factors for each decision\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "- a model easily interpretable could be prefered (tree).\n",
    "- or a highly accurate model (less interpretable) could also be used upfront (NN).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputations:\n",
    "- Build more robust, generalisable imputations (eg. impute future test samples with missing gender based on all easily interpretable categories group_composition_label and group_composition_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automate NaNs imputation for future test samples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reconstruct some NaNs by training models to predict the feature\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets handling\n",
    "- I made the choice to keep the train and test sets split. This is to prevent gaining insight from the test set while doing pre-processing, analysis and while training the model. To prevent duplicate code, I thus placed most of the inner workings in the class Analysis, which makes the reading less fluent. To improve, see how to better combine the visual aspect of Jupyter Notebooks, while maintaining code standards like DRY philosophy.\n",
